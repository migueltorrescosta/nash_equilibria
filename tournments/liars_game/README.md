# Liars Game

In Liars Game, a community of `n` players start with the same amount of money, and each round each individual selects how much they want to contribute to the central pot, which will be equally distributed with everyone. The community does not like selfish people, so they kick out the person who gives the least amount of money each round. This also means that if you give too much in the beginning, you will not have enough in the end to survive. What strategy will you use?

### Quickstart

I have the game class and some example solutions stored in this GitRepo, but the best way to get started is directly on the browser using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/migueltorrescosta/tutor/blob/master/Tournments/LiarsGame.ipynb). This way you do not have to setup anything locally
